# SIDLE: Tree-structure Aware Indexes for CXL-based Heterogeneous Memory (Baseline)
> This branch provides the implementation of baselines besides Caption, MEMTIS, and TPP (those are in the baseline2 branch).
## Part1. Environment Setup
<!-- > The following instructions are for Fedora 38. For other Linux distributions, please refer to the official installation guide. -->
>  NOTE: We only test the building procedure on Fedora 38 & Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with Linux 6.2.x.
### 1.0 OS Version
- Linux 6.2.x

### 1.1 Install dependencies
- gcc v13.2.1
- cmake v3.27.7
- jemalloc v5.2.1
- memkind v1.14.0
- daxctl 78
- libnuma v2.0.16
- libpmem v1.12.1
- libpmemobj v1.12.1
- libboost v1.78.0
- tbb v2020.3
- cityhash

### 1.2 Setup CXL device
Using the following command to check the information of the CXL device in the system.
```shell
daxctl list
# example output: 
# [
#   {
#     "chardev":"dax0.0",
#     "size":137438953472,
#     "target_node":2,
#     "align":2097152,
#     "mode":"devdax"
#   }
# ]
```
1. Make sure the `mode` of the CXL device is `devdax`.
2. Replace the value of `path` defined in `third_party/cxl_utils/cxl_allocator.c` with the `chardev` of the CXL device. (default: `dax0.0`)
3. Replace the value of `CXL_MAX_SIZE` defined in `third_party/cxl_utils/cxl_allocator.h` with the `size` of the CXL device.
4. Replace the value of `CXL_MIN_SIZE` defined in `third_party/cxl_utils/cxl_allocator.c` with the `align` of the CXL device.

Change the permission of the CXL device to ensure the program can acccess it.
```shell
sudo chmod 777 /dev/[cxl_path]
```
### 1.3 Setting up core bindings
Currently, we hardcoded the binding from thread id used in the implementation to the CPU id.
To avoid performance issues, please modify `bind_to_physical_cores` in `src/helper.cpp` accordingly.

Specifically, change `const int physical_core_n` and `int mapping[physical_core_n]` according to your machine.
The physical CPU id can be found by running lscpu in the terminal.
In our machine, we see the following output:
```shell
...
NUMA node0 CPU(s):     0-47
NUMA node1 CPU(s):     48-95
...
```
### 1.4 Build binaries
Use the following command to clone the source code of SIDLE and build:
```
git clone https://github.com/sidle-project/sidle.git
cd sidle
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j 24
```
Now, all the runnable benchmarks are in the `build/` folder.

### 1.5 Verify binaries
To make sure the binary is runnable, run the following steps that instantiate a S-ART instance with a small dataset, and run a read-write workload for 10s.
```shell
./rw_ycsb_origin \
    -a 0.5 \
    -b 0.5 \
    --target art \
    --runtime 10 \
    --warmup 0 \
    --fg 2 \
    --bg 0 \
    --table-size 200000 \
    --cxl-percentage 80 
```
You should be able to see the following output:
```shell
[Overall] MACRO: rw_ycsb origin
Read:Insert:Delete:Scan:RMW:Inplace = 0.5:0.5:0:0:0:0
target: art
...
```
### 1.6 Prepare dataset
The compressed Alibaba block trace file is available in [SIDLE's main branch](https://193659234@github.com/sidle-project/sidle). Please refer to the README.md file therein for details.

## Part2. Step-by-step instructions
### 2.1 Important notes
All results in the paper are obtained on dual Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8468V CPUs, equipped with 395 MiB CPU cache, 32 GiB Local DRAM, and 32 GiB CXL memory (connected via a CXL memory expansion card).

Most of our experiments will use 34 **physical** cores. Using fewer cores or hyper-threads might produce different performance results.
If you set a smaller number of cores in Part 1.3, errors might appear.
In such cases, please avoid use more threads than the number of cores you have specified.

### Unimalloc
We develop *Unimalloc* (the source code is under `third_party/cxl_utils/`), a unified memory allocator based on [memkind](https://github.com/memkind/memkind), to support both ratio-based and specific-type memory allocation across CXL and local DRAM.
Unimalloc offers equivalent replacements for commonly used libc memory allocation interfaces.
It provides two types of interfaces: one for allocating memory between CXL and local DRAM in a specified ratio, and another for allocating memory specifically to CXL.
Please check the [Unimalloc Interface]() for more details.
